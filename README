This is the Intel 8051 ArchC functional model.

To use acsim, the interpreted simulator:

    acsim i8051.ac                      (create the simulator)
    make -f Makefile.archc              (compile)
    i8051.x --load=<file-path>          (run an application)

To use accsim, the compiled simulator:

    accsim i8051.ac <file-path>         (create specialized simulator)
    make -f Makefile.archc              (compile)
    i8051.x                             (run the application)

There are two formats recognized for application <file-path>:
- ELF binary matching ArchC specifications
- hexadecimal text file for ArchC
